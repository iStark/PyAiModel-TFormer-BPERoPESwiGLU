# PyAiModel-TFormer-BPERoPESwiGLU

## Overview
PyAiModel-TFormer-BPERoPESwiGLU is a Python-based implementation of a Transformer model enhanced with BPE (Byte Pair Encoding), RoPE (Rotary Position Embeddings), and SwiGLU (Swish-Gated Linear Unit) activation. This project aims to provide a flexible and efficient framework for training and deploying state-of-the-art machine learning models for tasks such as natural language processing, time-series forecasting, or other sequence-based applications.

## Features
- **Transformer Architecture**: Implements a Transformer model optimized for sequence modeling tasks.
- **Byte Pair Encoding (BPE)**: Tokenizes input data efficiently using BPE for subword-level processing.
- **Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE)**: Incorporates RoPE for improved positional encoding, enhancing the model's ability to handle long sequences.
- **SwiGLU Activation**: Uses the SwiGLU activation function for better performance compared to traditional activation functions like ReLU.
- **Modular Design**: Easily customizable architecture for experimentation and extension.
- **PyTorch-Based**: Built with PyTorch for seamless integration with modern deep learning workflows.
